# Course 102: Offline Applications with Peer to Peer ðŸš€

## Overview

Too many of today's mobile applications are neutered when they have no connectivity. When wifi is down or there is no cellular connection, the applications stop working. Ditto is different. Ditto allows applications to continue operating in environments with hostile or zero connectivity. In this quick course we'll demonstrate how you can build great, fully functional applications that share their data, even when working offline, using the power of peer-to-peer replication. 

## ðŸŽ¯ The Scenario

In [course-101](../course-101/README.md) you learn how to build your first Ditto-powered App. That used the Ditto Cloud to replicate data. We're going to build on that and show how multiple devices can communicate and share data, even without a connection to the Ditto Cloud. 

We'll start by setting up multiple devices running the same app - creating our first mesh. Then we'll demonstrate how updates made to the same documents are shared across this mesh including how conflicts are handled as well as deletions. We'll explore some of the communication mechanisms that form the backbone of this mesh. The outcome will be an app that seamlessly synchronises data across devices without any external cloud connection!


## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives

This course will teach you the following:
- How to setup multiple devices for development and testing
- Creating your first Ditto mesh across multiple devices
- Seamlessly synchronising data between devices with no external connection
- Some of attributes of local bluetooth and wifi connections
- Understand multiple updates on different devices do and do not conflict, and how these are handled
- Best practices for deleting data in this distributed mesh
