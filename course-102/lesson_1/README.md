# Lesson 1 üöÄ Running on Multiple Devices

## Multiple Small Peers

In order to experience the full power of Ditto, we'll want to run our application on multiple devices (or simulators), syncing to each other without using the Big Peer. This will enable us to see how changes made on one device are seamlessly replicated to the other devices. To keep things simple, in this course we'll just be using two devices, but you are welcome to apply this to as many devices as you like. 

### The Ditto Mesh

We refer to multiple devices that are connected together and synchronising as being in a `Mesh`. When you you see the word Mesh referenced, we will be referring to a collection of connected devices. In a later course we will show you how to incorporate tools into your applciations so you can see which devices are participating in the mesh in real time. In this course, our Mesh will consist of two devices. 

### Adding a Second device

## ‚ùì Knowledge Check 

TODO
1. What is a Mesh?
2. How many devices can participate in a mesh?
3. What are some of the main communication methods used to create the mesh

The answers can be found in the [answer file](.answer).

## Summary

üéâ Congratulations üôå! In this lesson, you have learned:
- How to setup and install your ditto-powered application on multiple devices
- The Ditto Mesh of connected Small Peers

## Next Steps

Now we have multiple devices setup, we can start making changes on those different devices and see how data is sync'd
